# ConnectFour
A simple Connect Four game, built using C++, and runs in the terminal

This Connect Four game takes the approach of using a more OOP practice of using classes and member variables/functions to achieve a result. It uses a main.cpp that initializes a ConnectFourBoard. From there, it uses the member variables and functions of the ConnectFourBoard class to run the game proper - placing a checker, validating positions, determining game over.

when in the proper directory, simply compile the files using the command: g++ -std=c++0x *.cpp
run the project with the standard executable: ./a.out
