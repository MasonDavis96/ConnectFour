# ConnectFour
A simple Connect Four game, built using C++, and runs in the terminal<br>

This Connect Four game takes the approach of using a more OOP practice of using classes and member variables/functions to achieve a result. It uses a main.cpp that initializes a ConnectFourBoard. From there, it uses the member variables and functions of the ConnectFourBoard class to run the game proper - placing a checker, validating positions, determining game over.<br>

This project only took me a few days to complete, but the act of figuring out the best way to construct a game of Connect Four through code was the main challenge, and fun, of this assignment in my Object Oriented Programming class. This assignment was built to instill into me the benefits and proper way of constructing some of these programs. Using classes, and member functions to build and use the objects rather than have everything in a single file, and acessible to all. It was meant to teach me the basics of how OOP works.<br>

when in the proper directory, simply compile the files using the command: `g++ -std=c++0x *.cpp`<br>
run the project with the standard executable: `./a.out`
